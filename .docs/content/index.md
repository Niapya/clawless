description: A serverless AI agent

ClawLess is a free AI agent deployed on Vercel — a lightweight alternative to OpenClaw and Manus.

> **It's simple, free, open-source, and easy to deploy to Vercel.**

You don't need a Mac Mini, a VPS, or any dedicated hosting — all you need is **a free Vercel account** and **an AI API key**.

ClawLess provides the core features you'd expect from OpenClaw: Chat, Skills, Memory (with RAG search), Channels, Bash tools (running in the sandbox), and Cron jobs. It also includes features inspired by Manus, such as Files, MCP, and Sub-Agents.

We consider ClawLess a lightweight agent. It's not the best place to run complex workloads, but it's free, easy to deploy, and can connect to your IM platforms.

We recommend using lightweight or free models to try ClawLess — for example, `stepfun-3.5-flash` is a great choice.

Just one button to deploy.

## Get Started

Click the `Deploy to Vercel` button to open the deployment page.

> If you don’t have a Vercel account yet, sign up using your GitHub account.

![Deploy with Vercel](/clawless/images/deploy-to-vercel.png)

Select a team and name the project `clawless`, then click Next.

![Add Blob](/clawless/images/add-blob-product.png)

Then follow the prompts to add the **three** required products (Blob, Upstash for Redis, and Neon). When creating the Blob store, set it to `public`.

When adding these products, you can choose any name, region, or plan you like; we recommend selecting the free plan.

Next, add the following environment variables:

- `AUTH_SECRET` — used for encryption.
- `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` — used for login.

<div id="deployment-env-vars"><pre style="margin:1rem;padding:1rem;overflow:auto;"><code id="deployment-env-vars-code">Generating...</code></pre></div>

<script>
(() => {
	const chars =
		'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789';

	const createRandomString = (length = 10) =>
		Array.from({ length }, () => chars[Math.floor(Math.random() * chars.length)]).join('');

	const code = document.getElementById('deployment-env-vars-code');

	if (!code) {
		return;
	}

	code.textContent = [
		`AUTH_SECRET=${createRandomString(10)}`,
		`USERNAME=${createRandomString(10)}`,
		`PASSWORD=${createRandomString(10)}`,
	].join('\n');
})();
</script>

Then click the `Deploy` button. Wait a moment, and you will see a public URL.

> This will fork the repository to your GitHub account and deploy it. Save the resulting public URL.

![Log in](/clawless/images/log-in.png)

Open the public URL, then log in using the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` you just created.

![Add provider](/clawless/images/add-provider.png)

On the `Config` page, add your AI API provider.

![Config model](/clawless/images/config-model.png)

Then configure your Default Model and Embedding Model using the format `Provider/Model`, for example `openai/gpt-5.4` or `openrouter/stepfun/stepfun-3.5-flash`.

> If you use OpenRouter like I do, you can follow the example configuration.

In most cases, the context limit is inferred automatically. The context limit determines how far back ClawLess compresses your conversation history; you can set a shorter limit if you prefer.

You can optionally set the temperature and output limit for each message.

![Save config](/clawless/images/save-config.png)

Don't forget to save your configuration, then enjoy chatting with your new AI agent!

Click the first card in `Chat` to start your ClawLess. It will initialize its built-in memory to personalize your agent.
